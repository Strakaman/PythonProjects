Programmed in Python 3.7

Uses Python's unit test library to test a TicTacToe game with known errors (python_qa_exercise.py)
To test working version with no bugs, open test_qa_excercise.py, and import the fixed version of the script instead (python_qa_exercise_fixed.py)
TTT_GameLoop.py is automatically pointing at the fixed version, so that can be run without editing, if you want to play a game of Tic Tac Toe.

The original TicTacToe class was not made by me (python_qa_exercise.py).
